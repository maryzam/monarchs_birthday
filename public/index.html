		<h1>Queen's Birthday Celebration</h1>

			<p class="item">
				The Sovereign's birthday was first officially marked in the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1748, for King George II. Since then, the date of the King or Queen's birthday has been determined throughout the British Empire, and later the Commonwealth of Nations.
			</p>
			<p class="item">
				The date of the celebration today varies as adopted by each country and is generally set around the end of May or start of June, to coincide with a higher probability of fine weather in the Northern Hemisphere for outdoor ceremonies.
